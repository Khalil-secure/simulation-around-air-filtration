# Air Filtration Simulation

This project was developed over two years of preparation for the engineering entrance exam with a focus on health-related subjects. I collaborated with a team member who shared the same subjects, and we each worked independently. The subject we tackled was air filtration, primarily centered around the physics of aerosols, which were a crucial component of the oral examination. However, the importance of code development in this context was often overlooked. As a result, I have decided to share this project as an example of self-auditing and as a case study.

I chose to represent air filtration by simulating condensed particles forming spheres and their movement in the air, which is influenced by various factors such as air velocity, temperature, air flux, and more. The Brownian motion theorem describes this movement as essentially random and unpredictable.

# Brownian Motion

Brownian motion, also known as Brownian movement, asserts that the motion of particles in the air is random and can occur in any direction at any moment. This simulation simplifies the understanding of particle movement within a medium, providing valuable insights for learning how to control and manage them effectively.

# Simulating Air Flow around a Fiber

Understanding the impact of air filtration on filtering the air necessitates simulating the airflow around a fiber. This simulation focuses on an object placed at the center of the graph and predicts the effects of linear air velocity (vitesse lin√©aire) and rotational air velocity (vitesse rotatif) around that object.

On the left, the velocity indicates a significant reduction in the speed of air around the fiber, facilitating the settlement of aerosols. On the right, it illustrates the veracity, explaining the captive nature of air around objects, which also aids in the capture of aerosols. This graph's characteristics change depending on the speed of air and the diameter of the fiber.
